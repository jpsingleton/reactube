# Reactube

A London transport (Tube, Overground, TfL/Crossrail, DLR, tram) status page written in the React JavaScript framework. It's lightweight and mobile-friendly, as I find the [official page](https://tfl.gov.uk/tube-dlr-overground/status/) a bit bloated.

I've been meaning to modernize my original mobile-friendly tube status page for a while, and learn a new framework in the process. I've written the process up in a tutorial style, as I find explaining things to others aids learning.

Sorry for the bright colours, but those are the official ones. :rainbow:
